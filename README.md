# CharCalc_v1
The first version of the library for mathematical calculations on char arrays.

This is just an archive of part of the library I wrote for one college project.
At that time, I did not know many good programming practices and programming paradigms.
This version will not be continued. Most likely, a new version will be created, written in a completely different way.

May not work "out of the box"
